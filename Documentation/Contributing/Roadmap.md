## Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) roadmap

The Mixed Reality Toolkit is an all-new product, built to be cross MR/AR/VR/XR platform by design. There are two planned pre-releases after which the Mixed Reality Toolkit will become the primary product.

The Mixed Reality Toolkit will require Unity 2018.4.

> When Unity releases an LTS (Long Term Support) product, the Mixed Reality Toolkit will update to the LTS release. MRTK will also support the latest non-beta (ex: 2019.1) tech branch version of Unity, at the time at which MRTK was released.

Status: In development

Timeline: March/April 2020

Themes:

- Stability

- User Experience
- Platform expansion: Hands

**Stability**

Quality and stability are the top priority for this and all Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit releases. We will continue to prioritize customer and partner issues that impact the stability of MRTK components.

**Developer education**

[Developer documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) and example scenes are, like stability, an ongoing priority for the MRTK team.

**User Experience**

- Bug fixes
- HoloLens Shell parity
- Graduating experimental features
- Tests to ensure features do not regress

**Platform expansion: Hands**

As part of the hand extensibility theme, MRTK plans on adding support for the Leap Motion hands controller and Oculus Quest. Support for Leap Motion is expected to be made available on both Unity 2018.4 and 2019. Oculus Quest, including articulated hands, will be delivered via [Unity's new XR platform](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2020/01/24/unity-xr-platform-updates/).
